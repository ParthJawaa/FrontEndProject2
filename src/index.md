# My Work:
<br>

### I made a recreation of the Canberra Art biennial official website for one of the units I studied in the recent semester, where we pulled the content straight from the official website <a href="https://www.contour556.com.au/">Canberra Art Biennial</a> I basically added an arty theme to the project and made the content condense into a fewer section or pages.

### I felt like there was too much content on the nav bar rigth on the index page which I found was overwhelming to look at, so I made it appear as cards for user to pick as shown below: <br>

# AI recognition app

## I did this fun project which is basically a text and object recognizer, also for an unit I studied at Uni. We used Android Studio and Java to make this project.
