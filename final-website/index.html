<h1>My Work:</h1>
<br>
<h3>I made a recreation of the Canberra Art biennial official website for one of the units I studied in the recent semester, where we pulled the content straight from the official website <a href="https://www.contour556.com.au/">Canberra Art Biennial</a> I basically added an arty theme to the project and made the content condense into a fewer section or pages.</h3>
