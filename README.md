This Project was something completely new for me as i have never used an ssg before, but turned ou to be great for a project i have been wanting to start for a few months now.

I wanted to built a portfolio to include in on my resume so I can show mmy apps and websites built in the past and make sure I have everything I need to land a job in my field.

it turned out to be a great push for me to start working on my portfolio, at the moment all the content is populated onto the index page, later on when I start editing the portfolio again I can add the other pages and separate my study and project work.

Found it really simple to generate a portfolio with help of the ssg, I might create a different base template for the portfolio in the future but for now I really can use this template to create a portfolio.

I did have a problem to understand how things work using eleventy for which I had to read  a blog and follow all the steps to get a basic idea of how things work around using ssg.
